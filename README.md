# GoFetch-Dog-Gallery
My first React application. Very simple, but has a nice looking interactive UI. Fetches Dog images to display in a gallery using DOM and API Fetching.
Please ensure to extract the .zip file, put it anywhere on your machine, open Visual Studio Code and type "npm start" to get it up and running. The full build is also included.
